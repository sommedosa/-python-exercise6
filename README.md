# Repetition 

## Repetition structures
* Condition-controlled loops
* Count-controlled loops
* Nested loops


The while Loop: a Condition-Controlled Loop
The for Loop: a Count-Controlled Loop
Infinite loop: loop that does not have a way of stopping
>Repeats until program is interrupted
>Occurs when programmer forgets to include stopping code in the loop

## Range function 
- used in for loops 
- used to generate a sequence with numbers in increasing and descending order
- returns an iterable object
- does not include the ending limit

## range characteristics:
- One argument: used as ending limit 
- Two arguments: starting value and ending limit
- Three arguments: third argument is step value 

Calculating a Running Total, Typically include two elements:
- A loop that reads each number in series
- An accumulator variable

The Augmented Assignment Operators
- special set of operators designed for this type of job
- the variable on the left side of the = operator also appears on the right side of the = operator

Iterable: contains a sequence of values that can be iterated over
Sentinel: special value that marks the end of a sequence of items
Input validation: inspecting input before it is processed by the program
Nested loop: loop that is contained inside another loop

Key points about nested loops:
- Inner loop goes through all of its iterations for each iteration of outer loop
- Inner loops complete their iterations faster than outer loops
- Total number of iterations in nested loop:
