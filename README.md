# Repetition 

## Repetition structures
* Condition-controlled loops
* Count-controlled loops
* Nested loops
 </br> </br>

#### The while Loop: a Condition-Controlled Loop </br>
#### The for Loop: a Count-Controlled Loop </br>
#### Infinite loop: loop that does not have a way of stopping </br>
- Repeats until program is interrupted </br>
- Occurs when programmer forgets to include stopping code in the loop </br> </br>

## Range function 
- used in for loops  </br>
- used to generate a sequence with numbers in increasing and descending order </br>
- returns an iterable object </br>
- does not include the ending limit </br> </br>

## Range characteristics:
- One argument: used as ending limit  </br>
- Two arguments: starting value and ending limit </br>
- Three arguments: third argument is step value  </br> </br>

## Calculating a Running Total, Typically include two elements: </br>
- A loop that reads each number in series </br>
- An accumulator variable </br> </br>

## The Augmented Assignment Operators </br>
- special set of operators designed for this type of job </br>
- the variable on the left side of the = operator also appears on the right side of the = operator </br> </br>
